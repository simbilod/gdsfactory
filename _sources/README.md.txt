gdsfactory is a python library to design chips (Photonics, Analog, Quantum, MEMs ...)

You can describe your circuits in code (python or YAML), verify them (DRC, simulation, extraction) and validate them (to make sure they meet the specifications after fabrication).

![workflow](https://i.imgur.com/abvxJJw.png)

It provides you and end to end design flow to:

- Design (Layout, Simulation, Optimization)
  - Define Components using parametric cells functions in python or YAML.
  - Test component settings, ports and geometry to avoid unwanted regressions.
  - Capture design intent in a schematic.
- Verify (DRC, DFM, LVS)
  - Run simulations directly from the layout thanks to the simulation interfaces. No need to draw the geometry more than once.
    - Run Component simulations (solve modes, FDTD, EME, TCAD, thermal ...)
    - Run Circuit simulations from the Component netlist (Sparameters, Spice ...)
    - Build Component models and study Design For Manufacturing.
  - Create DRC rule decks in Klayout.
  - Ensure complex layouts match their design intent (Layout Versus Schematic).
- Validate
  - Define layout and test protocols simultaneously, so when the chips come back you already know how to test and analyze them.
  - Model extraction: extract the important parameters for each component.
  - Build a data pipeline from raw data, to structured data and dashboards for monitoring your chip performance.

As input, you write python or YAML code.

As output you write a GDSII or OASIS file that you can send to your foundry for fabrication.
It also exports component settings (for measurement and data analysis) and netlists (for circuit simulations) in YAML.

![flow](https://i.imgur.com/XbhWJDz.png)

It provides you a common syntax for design (KLayout, gdstk, Ansys Lumerical, tidy3d, MEEP, MPB, DEVSIM, SAX, ...), verification and validation.

Multiple Silicon Photonics foundries have gdsfactory PDKs available. Talk to your foundry to access their gdsfactory PDK.

You can also access:

- open source PDKs available on GitHub
  - [UBCPDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/ubc/README.html)
  - [skywater130](https://gdsfactory.github.io/skywater130/README.html)
- instructions on [how to build your own PDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/08_pdk.html)
- instructions on [how to import a PDK from a library of fixed GDS cells](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/09_pdk_import.html)

## Installation

You have 3 options to install gdsfactory.

### 1. Installation for new python users

If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download the gdsfactory installer](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/releases) that includes python3, miniconda and all gdsfactory plugins.

### 2. Installation for new gdsfactory users

Once you have python installed, open Anaconda Prompt and then install the latest gdsfactory using pip.

![anaconda prompt](https://i.imgur.com/Fyal5sT.png)

```
pip install gdsfactory --upgrade
gf tool install
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure you activate the klayout gdsfactory integration.

### 3. Installation for developers

For developers you need to fork the GitHub repository, git clone it (download it), git add, git commit, git push your improvement. Then pull request your changes to the main branch from the GitHub website.
For that you can install gdsfactory locally on your computer in `-e` edit mode.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory.git
cd gdsfactory
pip install -e . pre-commit
pre-commit install
gf tool install
```

### Update gdsfactory

- Users can `pip install gdsfactory --upgrade`
- Developers can `git pull` on the repository you downloaded and installed on your computer.

### Install gdsfactory plugins

You need to install the plugins separately

You can install most plugins with `pip install gdsfactory[full,gmsh,tidy3d,devsim,meow,database] --upgrade`

Or you can install only the ones you need.

- `pip install gdsfactory[full]` for 3D rendering.
- `pip install gdsfactory[tidy3d]` tidy3d plugin for FDTD simulations on the cloud.
- `pip install gdsfactory[gmsh]` for mesh plugins.
- `pip install gdsfactory[devsim]` for TCAD simulations.
- `pip install gdsfactory[meow]` for EME (Eigen Mode Expansion) simulations.
- `mamba install pymeep=*=mpi_mpich_* -y` for open source FDTD MEEP simulations. Notice that it works for MacOS and Linux, so for Windows you need to use the [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

```bash
docker build -t joamatab/gdsfactory .

## Testimonals

"I've used **gdsfactory** since 2017 for all my chip tapeouts. I love that it is fast, easy to use, and easy to extend. It's the only tool that allows us to have an end-to-end chip design flow (design, verification and validation)."

"I've relied on **gdsfactory** for several tapeouts over the years. It's the only tool I've found that gives me the flexibility and scalability I need for a variety of projects."

<div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Alec Hammond - <strong>Meta Reality Labs Research</strong>

---

"The best photonics layout tool I've used so far and it is leaps and bounds ahead of any commercial alternatives out there. Feels like gdsfactory is freeing photonics."

<div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Hasitha Jayatilleka - <strong>LightIC Technologies</strong>

---

"As an academic working on large scale silicon photonics at CMOS foundries I've used gdsfactory to go from nothing to full-reticle layouts rapidly (in a few days). I particularly appreciate the full-system approach to photonics, with my layout being connected to circuit simulators which are then connected to device simulators. Moving from legacy tools such as gdspy and phidl to gdsfactory has sped up my workflow at least an order of magnitude."

<div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Alex Sludds - <strong>MIT</strong>

---

"I use gdsfactory for all of my photonic tape-outs. The Python interface makes it easy to version control individual photonic components as well as entire layouts, while integrating seamlessly with KLayout and most standard photonic simulation tools, both open-source and commercial.

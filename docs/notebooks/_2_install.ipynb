    "\n",
    "Install [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/build.html) to visualize the GDS files that you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 3 options to install gdsfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install python with gdsfactory already installed (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install [latest gdsfactory release](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/releases)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install gdsfactory on your python environment (advanced users)\n",
    "\n",
    "Install gdsfactory on your python environment:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Users can `mamba install gdsfactory` for Windows, MacOs and Linux.\n",
    " - For installing plugins you can `pip install gdsfactory[full]` after installing gdsfactory. Note that some plugins need to be installed separately (see section below)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Install gdsfactory from GitHub (developers)\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can git clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/) or from your own fork.\n",
    " - run `make install` (Linux and MacOs) or `./install.bat` (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** that the latest versions of gdsfactory are no longer compatible with python3.6 and that gdsfactory==2.4.9 was the last version supported by python 3.6. Pip will select this version for py 3.6 environments, which is fundamentally and structurally different to the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mamba is a faster alternative to conda, for conda you can replace `mamba install gdsfactory` with `conda install -c conda-forge gdsfactory -y`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update gdsfactory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can `pip install gdsfactory --upgrade`\n",
    "- Developers can `git pull` on the repository you downloaded and installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install gdsfactory plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to install all the gdsfactory extra plugins separately\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install most plugins with `pip install gdsfactory[full,gmsh,tidy3d,devsim,meow,sax] --upgrade`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can install only the ones you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pip install gdsfactory[full]` for 3D rendering.\n",
    "- `pip install gdsfactory[tidy3d]` tidy3d plugin for FDTD simulations on the cloud.\n",
    "- `pip install gdsfactory[gmsh]` for mesh plugins.\n",
    "- `pip install gdsfactory[devsim]` for TCAD simulations.\n",
    "- `pip install gdsfactory[meow]` for EME (Eigen Mode Expansion) simulations.\n",
    "- `mamba install pymeep=*=mpi_mpich_* -y` for open source FDTD MEEP simulations. Notice that it works for MacOS and Linux, so for Windows you need to use the [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n",

    "## Docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one may use the pre-built Docker image from [hub.docker.com/r/joamatab/gdsfactory](https://hub.docker.com/r/joamatab/gdsfactory) or build it yourself with\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build -t joamatab/gdsfactory .\n",

    "For example, VS Code supports development inside a container, see [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for details.\n"
